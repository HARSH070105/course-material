# Course Material

Being an ECE Student, I have uploaded question papers relevant to that stream. Although, you can still find papers for the common courses like DSA, Linear Algebra etc-, and also for some CS courses. The comprehensive list of the available papers is mentioned below.<br>

**`Note:`** I have tried my best to add as many papers as possible. If some paper for a particular exam is missing, it is most probably because it was a worksheet-based test and hence I could not retrieve the questions.
